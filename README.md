## mind map for contrail troubleshooting
  - After careful review of each case, update the mindmap.

# Objective

This is an effort to map contrail cases to a quick troubleshooting mind-map

# Requirements

## Application : Freemind 
   Download the Freemind using https://sourceforge.net/projects/freemind/

It is available in most OS platforms including Windows and Mac

# Usage guidelines:

Use existing case notes to make the mindmap exhaustive

##Focus on resolution notes and emails to (customer notes)
   Also use logdata (if needed)

There are 2 files which will be maintained for building the map

1. contrailTroubleShooting.mm

2. caselist.csv


## Workflow

  Open ContrailTroubleshooting.mm (using freemind app)

  Review a resolved case, 

     Find the steps involved in resolving the case.

       Pay attention to Resolution notes, Category fields and most recent notes to the customer

  Identify the appropriate node in the mindmap diagram

  If there is no node matching the issue, we need to update the mindmap (add a new node with notes)

  Once updating the mindmap, update the case# and any remarks/notes to the caselist.csv
